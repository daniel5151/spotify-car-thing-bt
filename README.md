# spotify_carthing_bt

At the moment, this is nothing more than an in-progress port of core
functionality from <https://github.com/relative/deskthing>.

That said, I expect the two projects to start diverging pretty soon.

Connecting the stock firmware to host-side spotify is something I'm certainly
interested in supporting as well, though truthfully, I'm far more excited about
the possibility of writing a custom carthing daemon + gui app to do more exotic
stuff with the hardware.

Currently windows only, but it shouldn't be _too_ hard to get it working on
linux by using a lib like
[bluer](https://docs.rs/bluer/0.15.1/bluer/index.html).
